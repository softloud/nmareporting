# nmareporting

<!-- badges: start -->

`nmareporting::`'s objective is a living package and website that provides a collaborative open resource for practical toolchains to report Bayesian network meta-analyses in R. Included is a suite of R functions from packages such as multinma:: and nmathresh::, as well as providing scope for custom functions for specific use cases. Vignettes provided on the associated site give guidance for reporting for different scientific reports, such as Cochrane. Anticipating the adoption of threshold analysis, tools are provided for practitioners to augment standard sensitivity reporting. Reporting model results to stakeholders from diverse backgrounds and disciplines by particular bodiesâ€™ protocols is a key feature of evidence synthesis. nmareporting:: explores a template for collaborative and open development of practical toolchain walkthroughs that address specific scientific protocols. In addition to the intrinsic value for reporting network meta-analyses, nmareporting:: is also a case study in how we can bring together practitioners and stakeholders from different scientific organisations to collaborate on an open, shared tool for evidence synthesis.
