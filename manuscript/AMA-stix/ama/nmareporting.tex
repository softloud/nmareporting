\section{Network meta-analysis reporting}\label{sec:nma}

% why is it important

Pairwise analyses between treatment and control, exposed and unexposed, intervention and no intervention, are conventionally undertaken with meta-analysis. Network meta-analysis provides a means of comparing three or more treatments or interventions, including control or placebo. In particular
